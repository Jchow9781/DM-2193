                <p>
                    In the mid-21st century, crop blights and dust storms threaten humanity's survival. Joseph Cooper, a widowed former NASA pilot, runs a farm with his father-in-law, son Tom, and daughter Murphy. Living in a post-truth society (Cooper is reprimanded for telling that the Apollo missions occurred), Cooper encourages Murphy to observe and record what she sees carefully. They discover that dust patterns, which Murphy first attributes to a ghost, result from gravity variations and translate into geographic coordinates which lead them to a secret NASA facility headed by Cooper's former supervisor, Prof. John Brand.
                    <br><br>
                    Brand explains that 48 years earlier a wormhole appeared near Saturn, opening a path to a distant galaxy with twelve potentially habitable planets located near a black hole named Gargantua. Volunteers have previously traveled through the wormhole to evaluate the planets, with Miller, Edmunds, and Mann reporting back desirable results. Plan A attempts to develop a new gravitational propulsion theory, allowing a mass exodus from Earth. Plan B is a conventional launch of the Endurance spacecraft with 5,000 frozen embryos to colonize a habitable planet and ensure humanity's survival. Cooper is recruited to pilot Endurance and accepts against Murphy's wishes. When she refuses to see him off, he leaves her his wristwatch so that they can compare their relative time when he returns.
                    <br><br>
                    The crew consists of Cooper, the robots TARS and CASE, and the scientists Dr. Amelia Brand (Prof. Brand's daughter), Romilly, and Doyle. After traversing the wormhole, Cooper, Doyle, and Brand use a lander to investigate Miller's planet, where time is severely dilated. After landing in knee-high water and finding only wreckage from Miller's expedition, a gigantic tidal wave kills Doyle and waterlogs the lander's engines. By the time the lander's engines restart, they discover that 23 years have elapsed on Endurance. Having enough fuel only for one of the other two planets, they vote to go to Mann's, as he is still broadcasting.
                    <br><br>
                    En route, they receive messages from Earth. Murphy Cooper is now a scientist working on Plan A. On his deathbed, Prof. Brand revealed to her that Plan B was his only real plan, knowing that Plan A was not feasible without observations of gravitational singularities from within a black hole.
                    <br><br>
                    At Mann's planet, they revive him from cryostasis. He assures them colonization is possible despite an extreme environment. On an excursion, Mann attempts to kill Cooper and reveals that he falsified the data in the hope of being rescued. He steals Cooper's lander and heads for the Endurance. While a booby trap set by Mann kills Romilly, Brand rescues Cooper with the other lander and they race to the Endurance. Mann is killed in a failed manual docking operation, severely damaging the Endurance. Through a difficult docking maneuver, Cooper regains control.
                    <br><br>
                    With insufficient fuel, they resort to a slingshot around Gargantua. In the process, Cooper and TARS must jettison their lander to allow Brand and CASE to reach Edmunds' planet. Falling into the event horizon of Gargantua, they find themselves in a tesseract, possibly constructed by humans in the far future. Cooper can see through the bookcases of Murphy's room on Earth across time and weakly interact with its gravity. He realizes, he is now Murphy's "ghost". Using Morse code he encodes the quantum data that Murphy needs to solve the gravitational equation into the second hand of the wristwatch he gave her before he left.
                    <br><br>
                    The tesseract, its purpose completed, collapses and ejects Cooper and TARS. Cooper wakes on a station orbiting Saturn. He reunites with his daughter, now an old woman nearing death, who was able to develop the gravitational propulsion theory. Murphy reminds Cooper that Amelia Brand is out there alone. Cooper and TARS take a spacecraft to rejoin Brand and CASE, who are setting up a human colony on Edmunds' habitable planet.
